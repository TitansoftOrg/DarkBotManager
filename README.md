Validation System: Verifies all configured paths before operations

## 📋 Requirements
Python 3.6+ (if running from source)

Windows OS (primary target, may work on other systems but NOT TESTED)

No external dependencies (pure Python standard library)

## 🚀 Installation
### Option 1: Using Pre-built Executable (Recommended)
Download the latest release from the Releases page

Extract the archive

Run DarkBotManager.exe

The application will create necessary configuration files on first launch
This does not require python to be installed. It will work without it as any other .exe application

### Option 2: Running from Source
bash
 Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DarkBotManager.git`
`cd DarkBotManager`

 Run directly
`python DarkBotManager.py`
🖥️ Usage
Initial Setup
Launch the application

Click the Settings button (gear icon)

Configure the following paths:

Bot Root: Folder containing your bot instances (each in separate subfolders)

DarkBot.jar Path: Location of your updated DarkBot.jar file

Plugin Updates Folder: Directory containing plugin .jar files for distribution

Click Save

## Managing Bots
Refresh List: Scans the bot root and lists all detected bot folders

Clear & Update Selected: Performs all operations on selected bots only

Clear & Update All: Performs operations on all detected bots

Clear Logs/Old Only: Only cleans logs and old plugins without updating files

Validate Paths: Checks if all configured paths are valid

Folder Structure
Your bot root should follow this structure:
```bash
BotRoot/  
├── BotInstance1/  
│   ├── DarkBot.jar  
│   ├── logs/  
│   └── plugins/  
│       ├── old/  
│       └── updates/  
├── BotInstance2/  
│   ├── DarkBot.jar  
│   ├── logs/  
│   └── plugins/  
│       ├── old/  
│       └── updates/  
└── BotInstance3/  
    ├── DarkBot.jar  
    ├── logs/  
    └── plugins/  
        ├── old/  
        └── updates/
and more if you need
```

## 🗂️ Configuration Files
The application stores configuration in:

Config: `%APPDATA%\DarkBotManager\config.json`

Translations: `%APPDATA%\DarkBotManager\translations.json`

You can access the configuration folder via the Open Config Folder button.

## 🔧 Technical Details
Bot Detection Logic
A folder is considered a bot folder if:

It's a direct subdirectory of the bot root

AND contains either logs/ or plugins/ subdirectories

OR (fallback) any directory under the bot root

### Operation Sequence
When running "Clear & Update", the following operations are performed on each bot:

Delete all .log files in logs/ folder

Delete all .jar files in plugins/old/ folder

Clear everything in plugins/updates/ folder (files and subdirectories)

Copy DarkBot.jar to bot root (if source is valid)

Copy all plugin .jar files (except DarkBot.jar) to plugins/updates/

### Threading Model
GUI remains responsive during operations

Each bot processed in sequence (not parallel)

Progress bar updates in real-time

Detailed logging in the application console

### 🌍 Language Support
Currently supported languages:

English (default)

Polish (auto-detected for Polish systems)

Adding New Languages
Copy and edit translations.json in the config folder

Add a new language code (e.g., "de" for German)

Provide translations for all keys

Submit translation via pull request or other means (crowdin - coming soon, discord contact)

### 📝 Logging
The application provides detailed logging:

Info: General operation messages (white)

Success: Completed operations (green)

Warning: Non-critical issues (orange)

Error: Critical failures (red)

All logs are displayed in the application interface and can be scrolled through.
